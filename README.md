# Huffman Coding
My program features a command line interface (CLI) that allows a user to perform data compression and decompression. These operations are accomplished through Huffman coding. Assigning shorter bit sequences to input bytes that appear frequently and longer bit sequences to input bytes that appear rarely effectively compresses the input data.
